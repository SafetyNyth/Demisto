Demisto: The Operating System for Enterprise Security

Demisto is a security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform that combines full incident management, security automation and orchestration, and real-time collaboration to improve the efficiency of your security operations and incident response. Our orchestration enables you to ingest alerts across sources and execute standardized, automatable playbooks across hundreds of security and non-security products. Our incident management helps you retain control of known and emergent threats with six persona-focused incident views, fully customizable summaries and fields, and widget-based dashboards and reports. Our collaboration empowers you to improve investigation quality by working together in a War Room that facilitates analyst collaboration, remote execution of third-party commands, and auto-documentation of all actions.
